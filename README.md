# Google_Street_View_Bicycle_Rollers_Interface
Send info from a hall sensor on the rollers + on the handlebars (joystick module + scroll/left click/right click/toggle motion buttons) + Arduino to PC to control Google Street View and ride authentically at the same time.

I left earlier files but I have changed it to just using a BT mini Keyboard/pad.

And arduinos that have NRF2401.

I am chopping up a standard wheel sensor reed switch and using a wheel magnet.

330 ohm inline, 't' a 10k ohm to ground.

Press control + m on the KB to toggle motion effect.

I have now added a new version that uses OpenTrack for head controlled viewing.

Set it to FreeTrack 2.0, 127.0.0.1 port 4242.
