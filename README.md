# Google_Street_View_Bicycle_Rollers_Interface
Send info from a hall sensor on the rollers + on the handlebars (joystick module + scroll/left click/right click/toggle motion buttons) + Arduino to PC to control Google Street View and ride authentically at the same time.

I left earlier files but I have changed it to just using a BT mini Keyboard/pad.
And arduinos that have NRF2401.
I am chopping up a standard wheel sensor reed switch and using a wheel magnet.
330 ohm inline, 't' a 10k ohm to ground.
Press m on the KB to toggle motion effect.
